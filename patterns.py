"""Error fingerprinting and aggregation.

The point of this module: "the same failure happened again" is a question about
*shapes*, not strings. Two errors that differ only by a request id, a row count
or a temp path are the same failure. Normalizing those away and hashing what
remains turns a flat list of error text into countable patterns — which is what
makes "this recurs" a fact the plugin can assert instead of a guess it delegates
to the model.

Pure functions only: no DB, no config, no LLM. Everything here is unit-testable
without a Hermes host.

# Path normalization has to collapse volatile detail (``/users/8821`` and
# ``/users/9134`` are one failure) *without* merging errors that only look alike
# after normalization. Three boundaries carry that second half:
#   * a *forward-slash* path must start at a word boundary, so ``read/write error``
#     and ``read/execute error`` stay two failures and ``50/50 attempts`` stays a
#     pair of numbers. A backslash or a ``C:`` is not prose, so that boundary is
#     not imposed there — doing so measurably stopped real Windows paths from
#     collapsing (``…\dir\file``, ``…\dir\sub``).
#   * interior spaces are accepted only under a root that cannot be anything else —
#     a drive letter or a UNC prefix — so prose between two paths survives:
#     ``no such file /tmp/a and permission denied /tmp/b`` normalizes to two PATH
#     tokens with ``and permission denied`` intact, and a lone backslash (which in
#     tool output is often a literal escape, ``step1\nretry aborted``) cannot span
#     the words that separate two failures.
#   * an unrooted path (``src/main.py``) is only recognized when its last segment
#     carries an extension — that is what separates a real relative path from two
#     prose words around a slash.
