# Rollback

Split out of the README.

## Rollback

A successful mutation returns a rollback command only when its journal record is
actually reversible:

```
/refine rollback <journal_id>
```

Create rollback deletes a skill only if current content still exactly matches
the refine proposal. Patch rollback refuses to overwrite a later change before
restoring its pre-edit content. Memory rollback removes only the exact appended
entry and preserves unrelated later entries. Prompt-note rollback removes only
its exact unchanged note and preserves later notes; a changed or missing note is
a conflict and is left untouched.

### Where the restored content comes from

A skill patch records its pre-edit content twice: as a `snapshot` inside the
journal record, and as a `.bak` file under `journal_dir/backups`. Both come from
one host read, so they cannot disagree. Rollback prefers the snapshot, so losing
the backup file no longer costs the rollback.

Credential scrubbing needs two layers here, because the journal redacts
credentials from everything it writes — including a snapshot. The first layer is
the proposal path: a skill whose current `SKILL.md` is changed by scrubbing is
never patched at all, and the patch becomes a `no_op` before the model is
called. The second is a SHA-256 digest of the real pre-edit content stored beside
the snapshot. If the stored text no longer matches that digest, the snapshot is
refused and the raw `.bak` file is used instead, so redacted text is never
written over a skill.

`is_reversible` asks the restore path the same question rollback does, so an
entry is never advertised as reversible when neither source survives. In that
case rollback refuses with an explicit error and changes nothing, and a staged
rollback whose state cannot be proven stays `pending_rollback` rather than being
declared rejected.

Records written before snapshots existed carry only `backup_path` and keep
rolling back from it unchanged.

### Rolling back a transaction

Each edit of a multi-edit transaction owns its own journal record and its own
rollback ID; there is no transaction-level undo. Recovery IDs are listed
**newest first**, which is the order to follow: memory recovery is positional, so
undoing an earlier append before a later one shifts the later entry and its
rollback fails closed as a conflict.

If mutation succeeded but journal finalization failed, the returned recovery ID
points to the durable `prepared` record. Pending forward approvals consume budget
but are not advertised as reversible until the target exactly matches the
proposal. Rollback intent is journaled before its side effect; a staged rollback
returns a pending ID and is not called rolled back until the target change is
confirmed. A rejected rollback returns the entry to `applied`, so it can be
retried.
